MeasureTrack
============

Simple Android App for jotting down measurements.

I've been doing some little projects around the house recently and I always find myself texting measurements to myself in order to keep track of them.

So I'm learning to use the Master/Detail template and running through tutorials on http://referrals.trhou.se/williamdavis3 and decided I would use my real world use case as a basis for a simple app. I followed through the "BlogReader" app on TeamTreehouse, but decided to start branching off on my own.

The app consists of two modules

**onetwentyonegwatt.com.measuretrack**
This is our android app

and

**com.onetwentyonegwatt.MeasurementLib**
This is the various classes representing measurement types.
